you have a list of object?
to create another use push to put it
to update, make a copy, use id to get what you want
destructure what you want and edit it
finally assign the edidted list to the prev object

to delete you filter all item except the one you need

.push
.findIndex to find item 
make a copy of the time using spread op {...}
get the items you want to change and change them
call the original list[idenx] = update
